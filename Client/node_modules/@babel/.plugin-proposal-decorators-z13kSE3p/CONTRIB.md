These are notes about the implementation of the 2021-12 decorators transform.
The implementation's goals are (in descending order):

1. Being accurate to the actual proposal (e.g. not defining additional
  properties unless required, matching semantics exactly, etc.). This includes
  being able to work properly with private fields and methods.
2. Transpiling to a very minimal and minifiable output. This transform will
  affect each and every decorated class, so ensuring that the output is not 10x
  the size of the original is important.
3. Having good runtime performance. Decoration output has the potential to
  drastically impact startup performance, since it runs whenever a decorated
  class is defined. In addition, every instance of a decorated class may be
  impacted for certain types of decorators.

All of these goals come somewhat at the expense of readability and can make the
implementation difficult to understand, so these notes are meant to document the
motivations behind the design.

## Overview

Given a simple decorated class like this one:

```js
@dec
class Class {
  @dec a = 123;

  @dec static #b() {
    console.log('foo');
  }

  [someVal]() {}

  @dec
  @dec2
  accessor #c = 456;
}
```

It's output would be something like the following:

```js
import { applyDecs } from '@babel/helpers';

let _initInstance, _initClass, _initStatic, _init_a, _call_b, _computedKey, _init_c, _get_c, _set_c;

let _dec = dec,
  _dec2 = dec,
  _computedKey = someVal,
  _dec3 = dec,
  _dec4 = dec2;

let _Class;
class Class {
  static {
    [
      _init_a,
      _call_b,
      _init_c,
      _get_c,
      _set_c,
      _Class,
      _initClass,
      _initProto,
      _initStatic,
    ] = _applyDecs(Class,
      [
        [_dec, 0, "a"],
        [
          _dec2,
          7,
          "b",
          function () {
            console.log('foo');
          }
        ],
        [
          [_dec4, _dec5],
          1,
          "c",
          function () {
            return this.#a;
          },
          function (value) {
            this.#a = value;
          }
        ]
      ],
      [dec]
    );

    _initStatic(Class);
  }

  a = (initInstance(this), _init_a(this, 123));

  static #b(...args) {
    _call_b(this, args);
  }

  [_computedKey]() {}

  #a = _init_c(this, 123);
  get #c() {
    return _get_c(this);
  }
  set #c(v) {
    _set_c(this, v);
  }

  static {
    initClass(C);
  }
}
```

Let's break this output down a bit:

```js
let initInstance, initClass, _init_a, _call_b, _init_c, _get_c, _set_c;
```

First, we need to setup some local variables outside of the class. These are
for:

- Decorated class field/accessor initializers
- Extra initializer functions added by `addInitializers`
- Private class methods

These are essentially all values that cannot be defined on the class itself via
`Object.defineProperty`, so we have to insert them into the class manually,
ahead of time and populate them when we run our decorators.

```js
let _dec = dec,
  _dec2 = dec,
  _computedKey = someVal,
  _dec3 = dec,
  _dec4 = dec2;
```

Next up, we define and evaluate the decorator expressions. The reason we
do this _before_ defining the class is because we must interleave decorator
expressions with computed property key expressions, since computed properties
and decorators can run arbitrary code which can modify the runtime of subsequent
decorators or computed property keys.

```js
let _Class;
class Class {
```

This class is being decorated directly, which means that the decorator may
replace the class itself. Class bindings are not mutable, so we need to create a
new `let` variable for the decorated class.


```js
  static {
    [
      _init_a,
      _call_b,
      _init_c,
      _get_c,
      _set_c,
      _Class,
      _initClass,
      _initProto,
      _initStatic,
    ] = _applyDecs(Class,
      [
        [_dec, 0, "a"],
        [
          _dec2,
          7,
          "b",
          function () {
            console.log('foo');
          }
        ],
        [
          [_dec4, _dec5],
          1,
          "c",
          function () {
            return this.#a;
          },
          function (value) {
            this.#a = value;
          }
        ]
      ],
      [dec]
    );

    _initStatic(Class);
  }
```

Next, we immediately define a `static` block which actually applies the
decorators. This is important because we must apply the decorators _after_ the
class prototype has been fully setup, but _before_ static fields are run, since
static fields should only see the decorated version of the class.

We apply the decorators to class elements and the class itself, and the
application returns an array of values that are used to populate all of the
local variables we defined earlier. The array's order is fully deterministic, so
we can assign the values based on an index we can calculate ahead of time.

Another important thing to note here is that we're passing some functions here.
These are for private methods and accessors, which cannot be replaced directly
so we have to extract their code so it can be decorated. Because we define these
within the static block, they can access any private identifiers which were
defined within the class, so it's not an issue that we're extracting the method
logic here.

We'll come back to `applyDecs` in a bit to dig into what its format is exactly,
but now let's dig into the new definitions of our class elements.

```js
  a = (_initInstance(this), _init_a(this, 123));
```

Alright, so previously this was a simple class field. Since it's the first field
on the class, we've updated it to immediately call `initInstance` in its
initializer
